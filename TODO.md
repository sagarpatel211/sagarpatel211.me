# TODO

- [ ] Add ability to boost and snake changes color so users aren't bored with the speed
- [ ] On initial load of page, show a popup saying "Welcome. Feel free to slither around. Space to boost."
- [ ] Add a button to reset
- [ ] Add a minimap
- [ ] Add a button to toggle minimap to see the full site
- [ ] Add more colors so instead of 1 and 0, it's multiple colors and some numbers like 7,8,9 can be reserved for special areas like projects we insert into the map
- [ ] Optimize the code as there might be better ways like using an engine (?)
- [ ] Add a way to pause the snake movement
